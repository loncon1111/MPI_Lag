This is MPI_Lag, built upon my experiences with Lagranto (Sprenger, M. & Wernli, Heini. (2015). The LAGRANTO Lagrangian analysis tool â€“ version 2.0. Geoscientific Model Development. 8. 10.5194/gmd-8-2569-2015. )
Added features include:
- Building modules and functions.
- Using a set of namelists in different subproccesses.
- Calculating external variables: Lagrangian coherent structure, vector gradient tensor,...
- Running on MPICH for parallel workers.
